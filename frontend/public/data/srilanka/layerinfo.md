## Food security

### Food insecure

The proportion of food-insecure households is based on based upon WFP’s standard corporate definition using the Consolidated Approach for Reporting Indicators of Food Security (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wfp.org/publications/consolidated-approach-reporting-indicators-food-security-cari-guidelines">CARI</a>). The results are based on the nation-wide household survey conducted in March 2023 of 15,000 households designed to generate estimates at the districts levels.

### Livelihood coping

The Livelihood Coping Strategies is an indicator used to understand the medium and longer-term coping capacity of households in response to lack of food or lack of money to buy food and their ability to overcome challenges in the future. The indicator is derived from a series of questions regarding the households’ experiences with livelihood stress and asset depletion to cope with food shortages. The percentage values correspond to proportion of households engaging in activities that can erode their resilience to shocks.

### Food coping

The Food-Based Coping Strategies is an indicator used to compare the hardship faced by households due to shortage of food. The index measures the frequency and severity of the food consumption behaviours the households had to engage in due to food shortage in the 7 days prior to the survey. The percentage values correspond to proportion of households engaging in activities that is negatively affecting their daily food consumption patterns such as eating less preferred foods, reducing portions sizes etc. For more information, please see: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wfp.org/publications/consolidated-approach-reporting-indicators-food-security-cari-guidelines">Consolidated Approach for Reporting Indicators of Food Security (CARI) Guidelines | World Food Programme (wfp.org)</a>

### Food consumption

The calculation of proportion of households with inadequate consumption is based on the Food Consumption Score (FCS) indicator which aggregates household-level data on the diversity and frequency of food groups consumed over the previous seven days, which is then weighted according to the relative nutritional value of the consumed food groups. Based on the score, the households are then classified as having adequate or inadequate consumption. For more information, please see: <a href="https://www.wfp.org/publications/consolidated-approach-reporting-indicators-food-security-cari-guidelines">Consolidated Approach for Reporting Indicators of Food Security (CARI) Guidelines | World Food Programme (wfp.org)</a>

### Food expenditure

The Food Expenditure Share (FES) is an indicator used to measure households’ economic vulnerability. The higher the share of households’ consumption expenditures on food - out of the total consumption expenditure - the more vulnerable the households are to food insecurity. The map depicts the proportion of households in each district who are spending more that 75% of their total expenditure on food making them highly susceptible to economic shocks.

For computing the FES, it is required to collect consumption expenditure data through the standard expenditure module. This is composed by three sub-modules:
Food submodule (seven-day recall)
Non-food submodule (30-day recall)
Non-food submodule (six-month recall)
Each of the three modules must collect information on the value of purchases made in cash or on credit, as well as the value of consumed items from in-kind assistance and in-kind gifts. The food submodule module must also capture the value of consumed food from own production.
