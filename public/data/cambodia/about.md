# About PRISM

Platform for Real-Time Impact and Situation Monitoring (PRISM) is a web-based platform which supports the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM), other government agencies and partners to rapidly assess climate hazard risks and their impact, to inform disaster risk management and social protection programs. PRISM simplifies the integration of geospatial data on hazards, such as droughts and floods, along with information on socioeconomic vulnerability (IDPoor) to present decision makers with actionable information on vulnerable populations exposed to hazards.
