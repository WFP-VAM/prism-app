          <h2>What is PRISM?</h2>
          <p>
            PRISM is a technology solution which simplifies the integration of
            geospatial data on hazards such as droughts, floods, tropical
            storms, and earthquakes, along with information on socioeconomic
            vulnerability. PRISM combines data from these various sources to
            rapidly present decision makers with actionable information on
            vulnerable populations exposed to hazards, allowing them to
            prioritize assistance to those most in need.
          </p>
          <p>
            PRISM is designed to improve utilization of the wealth of data
            available but not fully accessible to decision makers particularly
            in low-resource environments. This is especially true of Earth
            Observation data which typically requires specialized skills and
            technology infrastructure to make it useful for practitioners. PRISM
            is open-source software which has been developed by WFP since 2016
            but with a major technology overhaul in 2020. Though the project is
            led by WFP, as open-source software it is open for collaboration and
            use by anyone.

          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <p>
            The objectives of PRISM are to provide greater access to data on
            hazards, particularly those generated from Earth observation data;
            to bring together various components of risk and impact analysis in
            a single system; to complement data from remote sensing with field
            data; and to provide tools to governments and local partners that
            foster local ownership and utilization of data for decision-making
            particularly related to disaster risk reduction and
            climate-resilience.

          <h2>Data sources</h2>
          <p>
            The data used in current deployments of PRISM are provided by
            government entities, as well as by WFP. These include data on
            various climatic indicators including precipitation and vegetation
            conditions, socioeconomic vulnerability data such as poverty and
            food security, and ground station data on various weather parameters
            provided by the Met Services. However, PRISM is designed as a ‘bring
            your own data’ application which can accommodate a wide array of
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            PRISM supports three primary types of geospatial data: raster /
            pixel-based datasets typical of satellite-derived products such as
            levels of precipitation and current vegetation conditions; vector
            data which is used to describe a geographic area such as a province
            or district with a single value such as level of poverty; and point
            data which represents a measurement at a given location specified
            with latitude and longitude coordinates.
          </p>
          <p>
            As PRISM requires external data as part of the deployment process,
            it is closely related to the forthcoming deployment of WFP’s global
            instance of the
            <a href="https://www.opendatacube.org/">Open Data Cube</a> platform.
            WFP’s Open Data Cube deployment provides climate monitoring data
            across more than 80 countries globally and is easily integrated into
            PRISM deployments. PRISM has also been configured to integrate data
            from other Open Data Cube deployments – providing a quick tool to
            display time-series raster data in an interactive dashboard. PRISM
            also integrates data from WFP’s related system –
            <a href="https://geonode.wfp.org/adam.html">ADAM</a> (Automatic
            Disaster Analysis &amp; Mapping) which provides near real-time data
            on earthquakes, tropical storms, and soon floods.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, the project has completed integration of data collected on
            mobile devices using
            <a href="https://www.kobotoolbox.org/">KoBo Toolbox</a> – a free and
            open-source field data collection tool developed by the Harvard
            Humanitarian Initiative with wide adoption across the humanitarian
            and development sectors. This integration allows data collected in
            the field to be visualized alongside PRISM’s other data sources in
            real-time.
